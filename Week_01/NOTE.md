学习笔记

After reviewing the java source code, right now I could tell the major difference of LinkedList and Array in terms of time<br/>
complexity of random insertion, random read.<br/>
Also, I would love to see how the array double the size after reaching the maximum capacity, while LinkedList don't have such issues.
<br/>
The quality of the assignment is recommendable. I get familiar with the two pointer strategy for solving both three sum and Linked List Cycle problem<br/>
Last not least, I learn the general methodology of five times coding. personally speaking, I have 550 leetcode AC, but most<br>
of them have just one submission. I will practice this methodology and to boost the coding ability.
